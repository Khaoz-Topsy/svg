# ForeignObject

You might be thinking about what other things you could include into your SVG if you can already make use of style tags

The foreignObject element allows you to include elements from a different XML namespace within your SVG. In most cases, that means embedding HTML content or even a canvas inside your SVG drawing.

## Hey look the ⭐️ is back

## Use cases

- Embedding styled HTML text in SVGs.
- Including interactive elements like forms or buttons.
- Rendering MathML for mathematical notation.
- Using canvas for dynamic drawing inside SVG.

Support is patchy, but many HTML things can be placed in an SVG

## Transition: I bet you are wondering where the limit is for foreignObject
