# What is a SVG

An SVG is a picture from maths.

You define how to draw the image in basic instructions such as lines, rectangles and circles

You define how to draw an SVG using an XML like text format. This makes it quite easy to edit, unlike normal images that require a tool such as Photoshop or Paint.net

On the top right you can see a little basic example of what an SVG looks like, the code on the left produces the image on the right.

the benefit of this is that you can scale an SVG when resizing the image, unlike raster images like png or jpeg files. PNGs and JPGs are built from lots of colored pixels rather than using mathematical algorithms.

Because SVGs are text based, their content can be read by screen readers, this is very useful for people who need help reading webpages. Search engines can also read and index SVG image text.
