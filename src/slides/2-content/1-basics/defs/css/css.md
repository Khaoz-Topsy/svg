# CSS

_I have some CSS code to talk to you about!_

You can use CSS in your SVG files, cool huh?

## Rules

You can use css to do svg things, like earlier we were using fill on the basic drawings and now we can do the same but with css

Because SVGs support CSS, you can also define and use CSS animations

## Transition: But what if you want animations but hate CSS
