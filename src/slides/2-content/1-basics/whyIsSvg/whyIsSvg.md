### Scalability

Raster image files save the colour information per pixel, so scaling these images only makes the image larger and does add pixels. **Creating a more blurry result**

Because vector images only store how to draw an image, scaling them up or down means that they keep their level of detail. This also means that SVGs can be significantly smaller than PNGs in some cases, like icons, logos, charts, and illustrations.

### Flexibility

### Accessibility

Because SVGs are text based, their content can be read by screen readers, this is very useful for people who need help reading webpages. Search engines can also read and index SVG image text.
