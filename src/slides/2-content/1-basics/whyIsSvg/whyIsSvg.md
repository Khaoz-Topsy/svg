# Why?

These are the 3 most important aspects of SVGS ~ me

## Scalability

Raster image files save the colour information per pixel, so scaling these images only makes the image larger and does add pixels. **Creating a more blurry result**

Because vector images only store how to draw an image, scaling them up or down means that they keep their level of detail. This also means that SVGs can be significantly smaller than PNGs in some cases, like icons, logos, charts, and illustrations.

## Flexibility

You don't need a program to edit an svg like other image formats like png or jpgs. They are text based. They integrate seamlessly with CSS and allow dynamic styling, animations and so on

## Accessibility

Because SVGs are text based, their content can be read by screen readers. Search engines can also read and index SVG image text.
