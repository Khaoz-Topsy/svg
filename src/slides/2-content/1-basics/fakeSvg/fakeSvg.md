# Fake Svg

This top example is what I sometimes see in the wild and it upsets me when I see it. I call it a fake svg.

Sometimes you will download an svg from google images or a sketchy website and it is a logo or illustration that you want to use but you notice that it doesn't scale very well. it is blurry when you enlarge it. And that can be because it is just a regular old image file put into an svg container

Literally none of the benefits and all of the downsides. But here is how you do it, in case you need it

## Network images

You can also load network images in the image tag of an SVG. In this example I also made use of clipPath and the star definition from the last slide to make this cut out Entelect logo.

## Transition: If you are getting tired of SVG code, I have some good news
