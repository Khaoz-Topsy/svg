# Basics

I am not expecting you to memorise all the code you are about to, just to understand for now, you can always come back to copy paste the code

## The basic XML

On the SVG tag we need to have the xmlns, you don't always need to include but it is safe to do so.

In this example we also have the height and width defined, these values are in pixels and are just how large the image will be displayed on the device

## Viewbox

It is like a window on the infinite canvas that an SVG provides. and the viewbox is what we see.

Examples of half-circle and quarter-circle images you could make by abusing the viewbox

## Transition: Now that you know the basics lets draw some more shapes
